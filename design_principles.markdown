#Design Principles

##DRY
Don't repeat yourself

##Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one reason to change, high level of cohesion

##Highlander Principle
One with the most specific wins (overloading)

##Encapsulate what varies
Identify the aspects of your system that vary and separate them from those that stay the same.

##Open Closed Principle
A class should be open for extension closed for modification

##Code to contract not implementations

##Favour composition over inheritance
