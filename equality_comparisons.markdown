#Design Patterns

##Iterator
Out of box, the IEnumerable interface is our contract for creating iterators
- Used to decouple a client from the structure of a particular data structure, for traversal purposes

##Specification
Determine whether an object meets a certain critieria

##Adapter
Make a object of one shape look like something of another shape

##Decorator
Add behaviour to an existing instance of a contract you also implement
